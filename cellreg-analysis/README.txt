1. You are going to need the following files:
	- Cell reg results folders (named correctly, ex. M1,M2,M3,....)
	- Good Neurones folder for both tests you are considering (ex. IMO, EPM). In case of IMO, both early and late
	- Results of the Metricas
2. Run
3. Enter the number of animals: (put how many animals you have cellReg results for)
4. Select the file called cellRegistere_blabla_blabla for every animal
5. How many of your sessions are IMO? One, both or none? (o/b/n): (indicate if you are analyzing only IMO, IMO and another session 2 other sessions)
6. Enter the name of the tests (ex. OF, OR, ...)
7. Do you want to select the good neurones for M1 in session OF? (y/n): answer for all neurons in all sessions
8. Select the good neuron folder for every test]
9. Select the file with the result of the matrics for every test (one at the time)
10. Save the files in the folder of your choice 


N.B.: if you are choosing the option "How many of your sessions are IMO? One, both or none?" o -> the you will also have to answer a later question on whether you want to analyze early (e) or late (l) IMO
